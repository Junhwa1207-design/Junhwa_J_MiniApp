# Mini App.

This is the mini-app that used SASS, VUE, AJAX, database, and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page. 
When it opens the app, it shows three mini coopers up and also emits each database about information
once it clicks button.
Now, it used "this.$emit methods" with vue.js, but I think it needs to try a lightbox for more specific informations include images.
